/*

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 5 and 1 is 3. Another example is LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

/*
Description
1. Traverse the Tree from the bottom to the top
2. if p or q is found return it to the parent node
3. Parent will check if p or q are found on the left and right side of itself respectively
4. If this is true, parent is lowest common ancestor
5. If this is false, p or q will be passed up to the parent

Completed with O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity
